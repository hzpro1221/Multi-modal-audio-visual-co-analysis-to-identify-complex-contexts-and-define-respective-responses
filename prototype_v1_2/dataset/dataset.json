        "script": "Get started. Kicking things off at level one: large language models. Popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Claude are applications built on top of large language models (LLMs), and they're fantastic at generating and editing text. Here's a simple visualization: you, the human, provide an input, and the LLM produces an output based on its training data. For example, if I were to ask ChatGPT to draft an email requesting a coffee chat, my prompt is the input, and the resulting email—far more polite than I would ever be in real life—is the output. So far so good, right? Simple stuff. But what if I asked ChatGPT when my next coffee chat is? Even without seeing the response, both you and I know ChatGPT is going to fail because it doesn't know that information. It doesn't have access to my calendar. This highlights two key traits of large language models: first, despite being trained on vast amounts of data, they have limited knowledge of proprietary information like our personal details or internal company data. Second, LLMs are passive; they wait for our prompt and then respond. Keep these two traits in mind.",

        "script": "Moving forward to level two: AI workflows. Let's build on our example. What if I, a human, told the LM: every time I ask about a personal event, perform a search query and fetch data from my Google Calendar before providing a response. With this logic implemented, the next time I ask, when is my coffee chat with Elon Musk, I'll get the correct answer because the LM will first go into my Google Calendar to find that information. But here's where it gets tricky: what if my next follow-up question is, what will the weather be like that day? The LM will fail at answering, because the path we told it to follow is to always search my Google Calendar, which does not contain weather information. This is a fundamental trait of AI workflows: they can only follow predefined paths set by humans. Technically, this path is called the control logic. Extending my example further, what if I added more steps to the workflow by allowing the LM to access the weather via an API and then, just for fun, use a text-to-audio model to speak the answer. The weather forecast for seeing Elon Musk is sunny, with a chance of being a good boy. Here's the thing: no matter how many steps we add, this is still just an AI workflow. Even if there were hundreds or thousands of steps, if a human is the decision-maker, there is no AI agent involvement. Pro tip: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a fancy term that's thrown around a lot. In simple terms, RAG is a process that helps AI models look things up before they answer, like accessing my calendar or the weather service. Essentially, RAG is just a type of AI workflow. By the way, I have a free AI toolkit that cuts through the noise and helps you master essential AI tools and workflows. I'll leave a link to that down below. Here's a real-world example: following Helena Lou's amazing tutorial, I created a simple AI workflow using Make.com. Here you can see that first I'm using Google Sheets to compile links to news articles. This is that Google Sheet. Second, I'm using Perplexity to summarize those news articles. Then, using Claude and a prompt I wrote, I'm asking Claude to draft a LinkedIn and Instagram post. Finally, I can schedule this to run automatically every day at 8 a.m. As you can see, this is an AI workflow because it follows a predefined path set by me. Step one, you do this. Step two, you do this. Step three, you do this. And finally, remember to run daily at 8 a.m. One last thing: if I test this workflow and I don't like the final output of the LinkedIn post, for example, as you can see right here, it's not funny enough—and I'm naturally hilarious, right?—I'd have to manually go back and rewrite the prompt for Claude. This trial-and-error iteration is currently being done by me, a human, so keep that in mind.",

        "url": "https://youtu.be/FwOTs4UxQS4",
        "script": "Keep that in mind moving forward. All right, level three: AI agents. Continuing the Make.com example, let's break down what I've been doing so far as the human decision-maker. With the goal of creating social media posts based on news articles, I need to do two things. First, reason or think about the best approach: I need to compile the news articles, then summarize them, then write the final posts. Second, take action using tools: I need to find and link those news articles in Google Sheets, use Perplexity for real-time summarization, and then Claude for copywriting. This is the most important sentence in this entire video: the one massive change that must happen in order for this AI workflow to become an AI agent is for me, the human decision-maker, to be replaced by an LLM. In other words, the AI agent must reason: what's the most efficient way to compile these news articles? Should I copy and paste each article into a Word document? No, it's probably easier to compile links to those articles and then use another tool to fetch the data. Yes, that makes more sense. The AI agent must act, meaning it must use tools. Should I use Microsoft Word to compile links? No, inserting links directly into rows is much more efficient. What about Excel? No, the user has already connected their Google account with Make.com, so Google Sheets is the better option. Pro tip: because of this, the most common configuration for AI agents is the ReAct framework. All AI agents must reason and act—so, ReAct. Sounds simple once we break it down, right? A third key trait of AI agents is their ability to iterate. Remember when I had to manually rewrite the prompt to make the LinkedIn post funnier? I, the human, probably needed to repeat that iterative process a few times to get something I was happy with. An AI agent will be able to do the same thing autonomously. In our example, the AI agent would autonomously add in another LLM to critique its own output. Okay, I've drafted version one of a LinkedIn post. How do I make sure it's good? Oh, I know—I'll add another step where an LLM critiques the post based on LinkedIn best practices, and then we repeat this until all best practice criteria are met. After a few cycles of that, we have the final output. That was a hypothetical example, so let's...",

        "chapter_title": "What is Machine Learning?",
        "url": "https://youtu.be/Yq0QkCxoTHM",
        "script": "In a nutshell, machine learning is a program that uses input data to train a model. That trained model can then make predictions based on data it has never seen before. For example, if you train a model based on Nike sales data, you can then use that model to predict how well a new shoe from Adidas would sell based on Adidas sales data. Two of the most common types of machine learning models are supervised and unsupervised learning models. The key difference between the two is: supervised models use labeled data, and unsupervised models use unlabeled data. In this supervised example, we have historical data points that plot the total bill amount at a restaurant against the tip amount, and here the data is labeled. A blue dot means the order was picked up, and a yellow dot means the order was delivered. Using a supervised learning model, we can now predict how much tip to expect for the next order given the bill amount, and whether it's picked up or delivered. For unsupervised learning models, we look at the raw data and see if it naturally falls into groups. In this example, we plotted employee tenure at a company against their income. We see this group of employees has a relatively high income-to-years-worked ratio compared to this group. We can also see all these are unlabeled data. If they were labeled, we would see male, female, years worked, company function, etc. We can now ask this unsupervised learning model to solve a problem like: if a new employee joins, are they on the fast track or not? If they appear on the left, then yes; if they appear on the right, then no. Pro tip: another big difference between the two models is that after a supervised learning model makes a prediction, it will compare that prediction to the training data used to train the model, and if there's a difference, it tries to close that gap. Unsupervised learning models do not do this. By the way, this video is not sponsored, but it is supported by those of you who subscribe to my paid productivity newsletter on Google Tips.",

        "url": "https://youtu.be/Yq0QkCxoTHM",
        "script": "Now that we have a basic grasp of machine learning, it's a good time to talk about deep learning, which is a type of machine learning that uses something called artificial neural networks. Don't worry, all you need to know for now is that artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain and look something like this: layers of nodes and neurons. The more layers there are, the more powerful the model. And because we have these neural networks, we can now do something called semi-supervised learning, where a deep learning model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. For example, a bank might use deep learning models to detect fraud. The bank spends a bit of time tagging or labeling 5% of transactions as either fraudulent or not fraudulent, and they leave the remaining 95% of transactions unlabeled because they don't have the time or resources to label every transaction. The magic happens when the deep learning model uses the 5% of labeled data to learn the basic concepts of the task. Okay, these transactions are good and these are bad. Then it applies those learnings to the remaining 95% of unlabeled data, and using this new aggregate dataset, the model makes predictions for future transactions. That's pretty cool. And we're not done, because deep learning can be divided into two types: discriminative and generative models. Discriminative models learn from the relationship between labels of data points and only have the ability to classify those data points. Fraud, not fraud. For example, you have a bunch of pictures or data points, you purposefully label some of them as cats and some of them as dogs. A discriminative model will learn from the labels—cat or dog—and if you submit a picture of a dog, it will predict the label for that new data point.",

        "url": "https://youtu.be/Yq0QkCxoTHM",
        "script": "We finally get to generative AI. Unlike discriminative models, generative models learn the patterns in the training data. Then, after they receive some input—for example, a text prompt from us—they generate something new based on the patterns they've learned. Going back to the animal example, the pictures or data points are not labeled as cat or dog, so a generative model will look for patterns. Oh, these data points all have two ears, four legs, a tail, like dog food, and bark. When it has to generate something called a dog, the generative model creates a completely new image based on the patterns it just learned. There's a super simple way to determine if something is generative AI or not. If the output is a number, a classification like spam or not spam, or a probability, it is not generative AI. It is generative AI when the output is natural language text, speech, an image, or audio. Basically, generative AI generates new samples that are similar to the data it was trained on. Moving on to different generative AI model types, most of us are familiar with text-to-text models like ChatGPT and Google Bard. Other common model types include text-to-image models like MidJourney, DALL·E, and Stable Diffusion. These can not only generate images but also edit them. Text-to-video models, surprise surprise, can generate and edit video footage. Examples include Google's Imagen Video, CogVideo, and the very creatively named Make-A-Video. Text-to-3D models are used to create game assets, and a little-known example would be OpenAI's Shap-E model. And finally, text-to-task models are trained to perform a specific task. For example, if you type @Gmail, summarize my unread emails, Google Bard will look through your inbox and summarize them.",

        "url": "https://youtu.be/Yq0QkCxoTHM",
        "script": "Unread emails. Moving over to large language models, don't forget that LLMs are also a subset of deep learning, and although there is some overlap, LLMs and generative AI are not the same thing. An important distinction is that large language models are generally pre-trained with a very large set of data and then fine-tuned for specific purposes. What does that mean? Imagine you have a pet dog. It can be pre-trained with basic commands like sit, come, down, and stay. It's a good boy and a generalist, but if that same good boy goes on to become a police dog, a guide dog, or a hunting dog, it needs to receive specific training, so it's fine-tuned for that specialist role. A similar idea applies to large language models: they're first pre-trained to solve common language problems like text classification, question answering, document summarization, and text generation. Then, using smaller industry-specific data sets, these LLMs are fine-tuned to solve specific problems in retail, finance, healthcare, entertainment, and other fields. In the real world, this might mean a hospital uses a pre-trained large language model from one of the big tech companies and fine-tunes that model with its own first-party medical data to improve diagnostic accuracy from X-rays and other medical tests. This is a win-win scenario because large companies can spend billions developing general-purpose large language models, then sell those LLMs to smaller institutions like retail companies, banks, and hospitals that don't have the resources to develop their own large language models, but they have the domain-specific data sets to fine-tune those models.

I'll talk about the Pro features at the very end since this video is mainly on the free version, but first I need to debunk a myth other creators are spreading. Buying the Pro version of Perplexity does not give you access to other paid AI tools like ChatGPT, even if you can select their models here. This is because even if they use the same underlying model, ChatGPT and Perplexity apply completely different fine-tuning methods. For example, Perplexity optimizes for accuracy, speed, and a more search-oriented approach. If you don't know what fine-tuning means, check out my video summarizing Google's Intro to AI course. But the bottom line here is, even if you can select the same models, you do not get the same experience as with other AI tools. Next, moving on to the Profile tab, this self-introduction section works just like ChatGPT's custom instructions, meaning the instructions you add here apply to all conversations within Perplexity. For example, my instructions include: structure your writing and respond like a consultant, adopt a conversational tone, use simple language, etc. And since we only need to add this once to benefit forever, I highly recommend customizing this to fit your needs.

        "script": "Now let's actually start using Perplexity by going back to the Home tab where you'll see the Focus feature. This basically lets you narrow down the sources you want Perplexity to use, which can drastically improve the quality of your output. For example, if I'm searching for real-time news like Nvidia's most recent earnings call, I want to search the entire web. For queries around fish oil supplements, I would focus on academic sources. For gym workout recommendations, I might turn to social, and if I wanted to learn how to perform a specific exercise, I might want to watch some videos. The Writing option is Perplexity's attempt at offering a more creative-oriented model, and as you can see, it generates text without searching the web. But again, in my own personal experience, I found the paid versions of ChatGPT and Google Gemini to be much better at creative writing. The Attach feature is a bit weird in that free users can only attach and upload PDFs, but not images. At the same time though, we can just convert images to PDFs and upload those, so I guess that's a workaround. Now let's go through a real-world use case: how to force Wi-Fi connection after connecting to Marriott Wi-Fi on an iPhone. Since I chose to search the entire web, we can see that Perplexity drew from a variety of sources, from Apple's Help Center to Marriott's Help Center to Reddit posts. I can click here to expand all sources and I can even choose to remove sources that are outdated or unreliable. Scrolling down, we see the true power of Perplexity. Instead of clicking through multiple links on Google to find the right answer, we are literally given a set of instructions to follow. By the way, this actually works. If you connect to a public network but don't see the login page, you can literally just type in example.com in your browser and this forces the connection. On the right is what I call supplementary information. Perplexity correctly identified that it might be easier for me to watch a video to troubleshoot my issue, so it provided a few videos here. In other instances, it might search for images to help with my query. Using an example directly comparing Perplexity to Google, I searched for the country with the most gold medals in the most recent Olympics. I actually didn't know the answer going into this, by the way—I didn't watch the Olympics except for the breakdancing part. On Google, if I click into the first link, it tells me the number of gold medals each country has won in the entire history of the Olympics, not from the most recent one, which is a little bit awkward. And even more awkward, I had to scroll all the way down to the fifth link to find that in the most recent Olympics, the US and China tied in the number of gold medals. That was a lot of clicking around and reading to find the information we wanted, right? When I type the same query into Perplexity, we actually get the correct answer right away, and Perplexity even includes a bit of trivia saying this is the first time in Olympic history that two countries finished with the exact same number of gold medals in the Summer Games. In Google's defense, I think a fairer comparison would have been to compare Perplexity to Google's AI Overview feature, since those two are in the same category.

Diving right into an example, I'm actually visiting Japan later this year, so I asked Perplexity when to visit if I want to avoid the peak tourist season. Since I know I'll be doing more research over the next few weeks, I can click the three dots up here, add to Collection, and click New Collection. Then I give this the title 'Trip to Japan 2' since I already have an existing collection from before. Down here, I can add an AI prompt that will apply to the entire collection. In this case, I tell Perplexity to assume the role of a seasoned travel agent with over 20 years of experience helping tourists uncover hidden gems in Japan. When providing recommendations, prioritize local experiences that are tourist-friendly. And now, whenever I start a new conversation or thread in this collection, Perplexity will remember to assume the role of a travel agent and give me answers tailored to my situation. Next we have a slightly more advanced use case. As you can see, I've instructed this collection to generate a structured outline for a slide presentation following the SCQA framework used by top consulting firms. I'll leave a link to the full prompt down below. Now, whenever I create a new thread in this collection—for example, gaming trends for the next few years and the impact on app developers, which is a topic related to my full-time job—Perplexity delivers an outline for a presentation I can start building on immediately. And although this workflow can also be achieved using custom GPTs and Gemini Gems, I'm much more confident in the numbers and data here, since almost every single one of these bullet points has sources attached to them.

I'm not going to read the responses, but if you pause the video you'll see ChatGPT's ideas are much more creative and relevant, and I ended up creating my thumbnail based on one of these ideas. Obviously this is just one example, but I can confidently tell you that as of right now, you're much better off using ChatGPT or Google Gemini for high-brain intensive creative tasks.

Paid users can also use the Pro Search feature up to 600 times a day, as opposed to just five times. Pro Search basically takes into account more sources, and the answers are more detailed than what you would get from a regular quick search. That sums up the main differences between Pro and free. There are some Perplexity features I didn't cover today simply because I don't use them. For example, if you click the plus icon here, you can create a page where Perplexity generates an entire blog post for you based on your initial prompt, and if I wanted to, I could click here to publish the page.

This feature has been driving the recent vibe coding trend where users just sit back and watch the AI do all the work, maybe giving some guidance here and there. To get started with Agent, you need a good prompt. I've linked some useful resources in the description to help with prompting. After giving the Agent your prompt, you can approve each change step by step, or if you're feeling brave, let it go full auto by activating Yellow Mode. I suggest using the Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking model, as it seems to be performing the best right now. Here are some settings I always turn on when using Agent mode: turn on Auto Apply to files outside context. Without this enabled, the Agent can't work autonomously to edit files across your codebase, which defeats the whole purpose of having an AI Agent. Also, turn on Iterate on Lints. This allows the Agent to pick up and self-correct any linting or type errors in the code it generates, saving you from having to manually re-prompt after error messages appear.",

        "script": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning: what's the difference? Are they the same? Some people frame it as AI versus ML. Is that the right way to think of it? Or is it AI equals ML? Or is AI something different from ML? Here are three equations—so which one is correct? Let's talk about it.\nFirst, when we talk about AI, it's important to define it, because people have different ideas of what it means. I'll use a simple definition: AI is about matching or exceeding human capabilities. We're trying to match human intelligence—whatever that means—and human abilities. What could that involve? Several things: the ability to discover new information, the ability to infer information not explicitly stated, and the ability to reason—putting ideas together to form new conclusions. For this discussion, we'll use that as our definition of AI.\nNow, what about machine learning? Machine learning is essentially a capability. Think of a Venn diagram: ML involves making predictions or decisions based on data. It's a sophisticated form of statistical analysis. The more data we feed it, the better it can make predictions and decisions. Unlike programming, where I have to write and change code for different outcomes, ML learns from data. That's the \"learning\" part. It's based on large amounts of information. Within ML, there are types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. As the names suggest, supervised learning uses labeled data with human oversight, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.\nThere's also a subfield of ML called deep learning. Deep learning uses neural networks, with nodes and statistical relationships between them, modeling how our brains work. It's called \"deep\" because it uses multiple layers of these networks. Deep learning can yield powerful insights, but we don't always know how the system arrived at its conclusions, making reliability sometimes unclear. Still, it's an important part of the field.\nSo, DL is a subset of ML. Where does AI fit in the Venn diagram? AI is the superset, encompassing ML, DL, and more. What else could that include? Natural language processing, computer vision, the ability to hear and interpret audio, text-to-speech, and robotics. Robotics, for example, covers motion—things humans do naturally, like tying shoes, opening doors, lifting objects, or walking. These involve perception and calculations our brains perform effortlessly.\nSo here's the takeaway: it's a Venn diagram with AI as the superset, and ML and DL as subsets. The right way to think about this is not equations. Machine learning is a subset of AI. When we do ML, we're doing AI. When we do DL, we're doing AI. But none of these alone define AI—they're just very important parts of it.",

        "url": "https://youtu.be/eHEHE2fpnWQ",
        "script": "Today we're exploring AI agents, a transformative approach to building systems that's reshaping how we think about software. We'll break down what they are, how they work under the hood, and how we can leverage them in our own projects. So what exactly is an AI agent? It's a helpful software assistant that can monitor what's happening around it, make smart decisions, and take actions to accomplish the goals we set for it. But what makes them fundamentally different from traditional software? While conventional programs follow predetermined execution paths, agents actively monitor their environment through inputs and sensors, process information through reasoning engines, make decisions based on goals and available actions, take actions that modify their environment, and learn from feedback to improve performance. This represents a paradigm shift from imperative programming, where we tell software exactly what to do, to declarative goal setting, where we define objectives and let the agent determine how to achieve them.\nModern AI agents are built on several foundational capabilities. First, agents operate across a spectrum of autonomy—from systems that merely recommend actions for human approval to fully autonomous agents that make and execute decisions independently. The engineering challenge lies in calibrating this autonomy for specific use cases, implementing proper guardrails, and building appropriate oversight mechanisms. Unlike stateless API endpoints that process each request in isolation, agents maintain persistent memory across interactions. This enables the handling of complex multi-step tasks by storing conversation history in vector databases, maintaining state data in structured storage, tracking action results and environmental changes, and passing contextual information between reasoning steps. When we provide this stored context with each interaction, the agent builds upon previous steps rather than starting from scratch, enabling coherent, extended workflows.\nMost modern AI agents use large language models as their reasoning engines. These provide the natural language understanding, problem-solving capabilities, and knowledge representation needed to function effectively. But an AI agent isn't just an LLM—the model powers the reasoning while the agent architecture creates the framework for action. What makes agents particularly useful is their ability to integrate with existing systems. They can execute code, call external APIs, interact with databases, and orchestrate multiple tools to complete complex workflows. When designing these systems, we focus on creating clean interfaces between the agent and its tools, making each component modular and maintainable.\nThere are several common types of AI agents worth exploring: simple reflex agents map inputs directly to actions, using if-then rules without memory. They are perfect for validation checks and monitoring alerts, where immediate response matters most. Model-based agents track world states with internal variables, allowing them to adapt to changing environments. Goal-based agents use pathfinding algorithms to chart action sequences that reach defined targets. Learning agents improve through reinforcement techniques, constantly adjusting their models based on performance feedback. Utility-based agents calculate outcome values using formulas and select actions with the highest expected payoff, allowing them to weigh multiple factors when making decisions.\nWhen building AI agent systems, we have several architectural options. A single-agent architecture deploys one agent as a personal assistant or specialized service. This works well for focused applications but might struggle with complex challenges spanning multiple domains. Multi-agent architectures coordinate specialized agents working together within a shared environment. Research agents gather information, planning agents develop strategies, and execution agents implement solutions. The technical challenge here is designing effective communication protocols between these agents. We might use shared memory spaces or message-passing systems to orchestrate their interactions. Often the most practical approach is a human-machine collaborative architecture that integrates agent capabilities with human expertise. The agents provide analysis and handle routine execution, while humans make critical decisions and provide creative direction. We see this today in programming assistants that suggest code alongside developers, augmenting rather than replacing human capabilities.\nAI agents represent a fundamental evolution in how we build software systems. By understanding these patterns, we can move beyond traditional programming paradigms toward systems that reason, learn, and adapt to changing conditions. These approaches provide powerful new capabilities that can dramatically accelerate our work.",

Now, agentic AI systems, by contrast, are proactive systems. Like generative AI, they often start with a user prompt, but that prompt is then used to pursue goals through a series of actions. An agentic system basically goes through a life cycle: first it perceives the environment, then decides on an action to take, executes that action, learns from the outcome, and repeats the cycle—all with minimal human intervention.",

Now, before work this morning—this is completely true—I used the chatbot to help write the next chapter of my Nelson DeMille fan fiction novel. And right now you're probably thinking how profoundly cool and absolutely non-nerdy this guy is. But for many of us, Gen AI does help with daily tasks. For example, consider how a YouTuber might use a generative AI system to review scripts, suggest thumbnail concepts, and even generate background music. But at each step, there is a human creator reviewing the generated content, checking if it's what they want—it probably isn't—and then refining it. They are really directing the whole process. The AI generates possibilities, but the human curates them. Now, agentic AI thrives in scenarios that require ongoing management and consist of multi-step processes, not just one thing at a time. Consider a personal shopping agent: given a product as input, it actively searches for availability across platforms, monitors price fluctuations, handles checkout, and even coordinates delivery—largely by itself, seeking input from you only when needed. But how does it do that? Well, it turns out that the LLMs behind much of generative AI can also provide reasoning capabilities to AI agents.

        "script": "This process has a name—it's called chain-of-thought reasoning—and it's something LLMs are very good at. It's where the agent breaks down a complex task into smaller logical steps, similar to how humans tackle difficult problems. Let's imagine one: suppose we want an agent to plan a complex task like organizing a conference. It will use Gen AI to generate an internal dialogue, which might go something like this: first, I need to understand the conference requirements—the size, duration, budget, that sort of thing. Then I should research available venues matching those parameters. Next, I need to check availability, and so on. It's essentially the agent talking to itself to explore the problem space before taking action. Gen AI is basically the cognitive engine driving an agent's decision-making. Looking ahead, the most powerful AI systems probably won't be purely generative or purely agentic. They'll be intelligent collaborators, understanding when to explore options through generation and when to commit to courses of action through agentic action—like an agent.",

        "script": "Agents are the new apps, and someday there will be thousands available. We want a thousand agents to bloom. Eventually, there may be more AI agents than people in the world. For the first time, this will be an industry of skills, with agents sitting on top of tools.\nIf you're here, it's probably because you've been hearing a lot about AI agents lately. Maybe you've watched other videos that got too technical and thought, why not explain it like I'm five? Well, that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'll give you the most straightforward, real-world explanation of what an AI agent is.\nYou already know AI stands for artificial intelligence. But here's the interesting part: AI by itself is just raw brainpower. It's got potential, but it's not useful until you give it a job. Enter the AI agent. Think of AI as the genius with a million ideas, and the AI agent as the one who actually gets things done. While AI is all about smarts, the AI agent is the hands-on version. It's like giving that genius a task and saying, go do something useful with all that brainpower.\nThe AI agent takes intelligence and turns it into action, whether it's answering questions, automating work, or handling your to-do list. It's the difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it. AI is the brain, and the AI agent is the one rolling up its sleeves to make things happen.\nHere's the one-two-three of AI agents: Number one, they understand. AI agents listen to what you're asking. Number two, they think. They process the information and figure out the best way to help. Number three, they act. They deliver what you need—an answer, a solution, or a completed task.\nNow, how do they work? Imagine your parents head out for the evening and leave a babysitter in charge. You're only five. They don't just walk out the door—they give instructions: bedtime, snacks, what to do in an emergency. That's how AI agents are trained. Developers give them detailed instructions using data, so they know how to respond in different situations. Some agents come pre-programmed with basics, like an experienced babysitter. Others can be customized, like giving the babysitter special rules for your family. Once set up, AI agents handle tasks smoothly, freeing you to focus on other things.\nSo what does an AI agent look like? Think of it as a combination of two things: an interface and a workflow. The interface is how you interact with it—through a chat window, voice assistant, or button on a website. Behind that interface is the workflow. Imagine a flowchart: you ask a question or give a command, and the AI agent follows a series of steps to deliver the result. The more you use it, the smarter it gets, learning from past interactions.\nWhy is this important? AI agents are about to trigger a seismic shift in how we live and work, especially for local businesses. Imagine AI handling routine tasks, freeing business owners to focus on growth and innovation. For local businesses, this could mean smarter customer service and more efficient operations, while agencies and service providers deliver more value with less effort. This isn't just another tech upgrade—it's likely the biggest transformation of our lifetime. Those who embrace AI agents now will gain a major advantage, while those who don't risk being left behind.\nIn short, AI agents are set to revolutionize work, and the impact will be massive. I hope this video helped you learn the basics of AI in an easy way. If you like simple explanations, please give this video a like, subscribe to our channel, and hit the notification bell. If you want to see how AI is helping businesses with customer service, sales, and project planning—including a live demo of AI agents—check out this video here.\nSo there you have it: an AI agent is a smart digital assistant that understands, thinks, and acts to help you get things done at home or work. And remember, this is just the beginning. AI agents are going to be everywhere soon, making life easier in ways we're only starting to imagine.",

        "script": "How do you keep AI content sounding human? Have you ever wondered how to make AI-generated content feel more like it was written by a person? It's a fascinating challenge many are tackling today. Let's break down some effective strategies to keep AI content sounding human, especially in the context of AI content creation and virtual assistance in the workplace.\nFirst, add personal experiences and anecdotes. Sharing real-life stories or insights creates a connection with the reader. For example, if you faced a challenge and found a solution, sharing that journey makes the content relatable. This is something AI alone struggles to replicate.\nNext, use emotional and conversational language. Human communication is full of feelings and informal phrases. Adjust AI-generated text to include everyday language and emotional cues. This helps the content resonate better with readers, making it feel more authentic.\nWhen working with AI tools, be specific and clear in your prompts and edits. Provide detailed instructions about the desired tone, style, and audience. After the AI generates content, edit it for clarity and consistency. This step is vital to maintain credibility.\nAnother important aspect is to use an active voice and keep sentences concise. Human writing often favors an active voice, which makes the content more engaging. Editing AI content to follow this principle improves readability and makes it more dynamic.\nIn workplace settings, integrating domain expertise and current information is essential. AI can generate content quickly, but humans can verify facts and add specialized knowledge. This combination enhances authority and ensures content is up to date.\nConsider using AI humanization tools thoughtfully. Some emerging tools can adjust the tone or style of AI-generated content. While helpful, they should always be paired with human review to avoid repeating AI's limitations.\nFinally, position humans as strategic directors and collaborators in the content creation process. In the evolving landscape of AI-assisted content, humans guide AI outputs. By defining goals and curating suggestions, you ensure the final product aligns with audience needs and brand voice.\nIn practical applications, especially with virtual assistance in the workplace, these principles greatly improve the quality of AI-generated content. For example, if a virtual assistant drafts a customer service email, a human editor can personalize it with details and a warm tone. This blend of AI efficiency and human touch enhances engagement and keeps communication human.\nBy combining thoughtful prompt design, human editing, personal storytelling, emotional language, and strategic collaboration, you can keep AI content human. This approach aligns with current trends in AI content creation, emphasizing the importance of human creativity and judgment in the process.",

        "url": "https://youtu.be/UKU-LOTLvEA",
        "script": "First we have the brain: the LLM, or large language model, which puts the AI in an AI agent. It's responsible for the thinking, planning, and reasoning that make the agent smart. Here's how an LLM works: we give it a prompt and it responds with an answer, but it can't perform tasks or actions. It's just good at thinking and responding based on what it has been trained on.\nIt's like a brain without a body. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Spock: 'Hey, do the thing.' 'I don't do that anymore.' To actually get it to do something, we need a helper—that's the agent—and it's going to need tools to get the job done. So now, instead of speaking to the LLM directly, we've got the agent sitting in between us and the tools. The agent has access to both the LLM and the tools. The LLM is still responsible for the thinking. Think of it as the decision-making engine that allows the agent to analyze data, reason, and make decisions based on the information it gathers. This is the part of the agent that processes information and determines the next action, while the tools carry those actions out.\nYou can connect all kinds of tools. They can link to other apps and software or pull information from data sources. Spiritual tools? No, sadly not yet. But, for example, we can connect to accounting software like QuickBooks through an API, allowing it to access your accounting data. An API, or application programming interface, lets different software programs talk to each other. We could also connect to a data source like a Google Sheet or Airtable to pull stored information. What about the environment? By connecting these tools and data sources, we expand the agent's environment—whatever it can access, whether it's QuickBooks through an API, a Google Sheet, or a customer communications tool like Twilio. All of this becomes part of the information it uses to perceive and make decisions. This is an example of a digital environment, where the agent gathers information from apps, software, databases, and online tools.\nOn the other hand, a physical environment involves the agent perceiving the real world through sensors like cameras, microphones, or temperature sensors. In this type of environment, the agent might see through a camera or hear through a microphone, allowing it to make decisions based on real-world inputs. Both types of environments provide different kinds of data, enabling the agent to function in various ways depending on the situation.\nSo far, we have the brain—an LLM or AI—the helper, or agent, and the tools like apps and data sources. Next, and this is what really makes AI agents helpful, is memory. It can remember important details like past invoices or payments from the accounting tool we connected. The agent can use short-term memory to handle things happening right now, like new expenses, and long-term memory to track business trends over time. Still with me? If you're finding this video helpful, please hit that like button to let me know. Thank you.\nFinally, we need a way to tell the agent what to do. It needs instructions—a set of instructions called a prompt template to guide the agent. This is how the agent knows what steps to take and what tools to use. Keep in mind, advanced prompts and instructions unlock the real power of LLMs. If you can master this, your AI agents will have a major advantage over your competitors.",

        "script": "See how an AI agent works in a real-life business scenario. Never send a human to do a machine's job. Here is a prompt template, or a set of instructions: you are a friendly agent that helps manage finances. If asked about financial information, use QuickBooks to gather data. If asked to send messages on behalf of the user, use Gmail or Twilio. Ask the user for additional information if needed.\nSetting up these instructions along with a list of available tools like QuickBooks, Gmail, and Twilio is part of the agent's configuration process. This allows the agent to handle financial tasks and communication. The business owner's query might be: which invoices are overdue? At this point, the agent prepares an overall prompt using the instructions, the user's query, and any extra information it needs. This is then sent to the LLM.\nThe LLM reasons that it should access QuickBooks to find invoices that are overdue. The agent then asks, would you like to check for invoices overdue by 7 days or more, or 30 days or more? The business owner responds, show me all invoices overdue by 30 days or more. Now the agent may choose to store this information in its memory—for example, that the owner is focusing on invoices overdue by 30 days or more. The agent then connects to QuickBooks and retrieves the overdue invoices. It pulls the invoice details, amounts, dates, and due statuses, and sends this data to the LLM to formulate a clear response. The LLM then responds: ABC Co. has two overdue invoices, totaling 1,950—750 due 35 days ago, and 1,200 overdue by 40 days.\nYou can view the full details and links to the invoices here: Invoice 1 and Invoice 2. Now, at this point, the agent provides an additional helpful option: would you like me to start sending reminders automatically to any accounts overdue by 30 days or more, or would you prefer that I notify you each time one comes up so you can decide how to handle it? The business owner responds, just send me notifications when an invoice is overdue and I'll decide what to do, thanks. The agent stores this preference, learning from the interaction. Going forward, whenever it detects an overdue invoice, it will notify you, the business owner, with links to the invoices, giving you control over how to handle each case. That's incredible, it's incredible. Agents are about to transform the business world as we know it, and the only way to stay ahead is by mastering them. Subscribe now to learn how to train, build, and sell these powerful tools—because missing out means getting left behind.",

Traditional language models predict responses based on data they were trained on. This data is static, trained on the internet and other resources at a specific moment in time. Language models don't interact with the world beyond their training data. For example, ChatGPT knows information only up until its last update. As of today, the last update was December 2023, more than four months ago. The model itself can't fetch or understand new events or data, so if you ask about the Max Holloway and Justin Gaethje fight at UFC 300 that happened last weekend—who won and in what round—the language models won't know. They'll probably try to make something up to please you, and that's what leads to hallucinations. Some language models have integrated web search into their applications. You might see that it has the ability to access the internet with Bing, partnered with Microsoft, but this is not actually part of the language model. It's something programmed on top of it.",

        "script": "A simple reflex agent is the most basic type of AI agent. It follows predefined rules to make decisions. Like a thermostat, it turns on the heat when the temperature drops below a set threshold and turns it off again when the set temperature is reached. Let's break it down: we have our agent here, and over here is the external world the agent is embedded in and reacts to. Then we have percepts—these are the inputs from the environment as measured through sensors. The sensors feed the percepts into the internal logic of the agent, giving it a representation of what the world is like now. Knowing this, we can condition action rules, the core logic of the simple reflex agent. These rules follow an 'if condition, then action' structure. For example, if the temperature drops to 18 Celsius, then turn on the heat. That's executed by actuators, resulting in an action—the output behavior of the agent—which then affects the environment. This, in turn, affects the next set of percepts, and the cycle continues. Simple reflex agents like this are effective in structured and predictable environments where rules are well-defined, but in dynamic scenarios, they can fail. Because they don't store past information, they may repeatedly make the same mistakes if the predefined rules are insufficient to handle new situations.",

It's a more advanced version of the simple reflex agent, and it uses condition-action rules to make decisions as well. But it also incorporates an internal model of the world, stored in the state component. That state component is updated by observing how the world evolves—essentially, how the environment changes from one state to another. The agent also tracks how its own actions affect the environment, and all of this is used instead of just relying on raw percept data for decision-making. Take a robotic vacuum cleaner, for example. Its internal state remembers where it's been, which areas are clean, and where obstacles are. It knows that if it moves forward, it changes its location, and that action has consequences. It has condition-action rules, like: if I'm in a dirty area and I haven't cleaned it yet, then vacuum it. It doesn't just react to what it immediately sees—it infers and remembers parts of the environment it can't currently observe. That's model-based reasoning.",

So we no longer have condition-action rules—we have goals, and they represent the desired outcome the agent is trying to achieve. The agent uses its internal model of how the world evolves and how its actions affect it to simulate future outcomes of possible actions, essentially predicting: what will it be like if I do action A? That's a shift in decision-making. The agent isn't just asking what action matches this condition, it's now asking what action will help me achieve my goal based on the current state and predicted future. Consider a self-driving car: if the goal is to reach destination X, it will consider its state—I'm on Main Street—then generate a prediction. If I turn left, I'll head toward the highway, and it will ask, will that help me reach destination X? If the answer is yes, then the action will be to turn left. Goal-based agents are widely used in robotics and simulations where a clear objective is set and adaptation to the environment is required.",

Utility here represents a happiness score or a preference value for a particular outcome. For each possible future state, the agent asks: how happy will I be in such a state, or really, what is the expected utility of that future state? This lets it rank options, not just pick anything that meets the goal. Consider an autonomous delivery drone: the goal-based version might simply use the goal of delivering the package to address X and choose any action that completes that goal, even if it results in a bumpy, energy-wasting route. But a utility-based version would instead aim to deliver the package quickly, safely, and with minimum energy usage. The drone then simulates multiple paths, estimates things like duration, battery level, and weather, and picks the route that maximizes its utility score.",

That generates a numerical feedback signal, often called a reward in reinforcement learning. This reward is passed to a learning element that updates the agent's knowledge using the critic's feedback. Its job is to improve the agent's mapping from states through to actions. Then there's a problem generator that suggests new actions the agent hasn't tried yet, like trying a different path to see if it's faster. The performance element selects actions based on what the learning element has determined to be optimal. Think of an AI chess bot: the performance element plays the game using its current learned strategies, the critic sees that it lost the match, the learning element adjusts its strategy based on the outcomes of thousands of games, and the problem generator suggests new moves it hasn't attempted before.",

        "script": "Intelligence leads to artificial general intelligence. Let's think about this part first, from where AI is now to AGI, artificial general intelligence. What does general intelligence mean? For the sake of this video, let's say it means whatever a human could do on a computer, an AGI could also do. I can already do the basics. We have systems you can connect to a regular computer, and they can look at the screen, figure out what's going on, send messages, search the internet, and so on. They're also getting pretty good at using external tools. Obviously, they can't video call people, but actually, they can. So they've already got the building blocks. The question is, how well can they combine them? They can send Slack messages, but can they run a company? They can write code, but can they write a research paper? And the answer is, not yet—but eventually, and maybe quite soon. After all, they just keep getting better, and if we extrapolate, it sure looks like they'll reach this point sooner or later. The jump from writing a short story to writing an excellent novel is pretty big, but remember that five years ago they could barely write coherent sentences. Now many people doubt this can happen, usually for one of two reasons. One is that AIs aren't really thinking deep down. It's interesting to consider, but whether AIs have genuine understanding isn't the relevant question here. What matters is the kind of tasks they can do and how well they perform them—and the fact is, they just keep getting better. It doesn't matter whether AIs really understand chess in the way humans do. What matters is that they can easily crush human world champions. The other main reason for doubt is the idea that AI is going to hit some kind of wall, and some tasks will just be too hard. But even if this does happen, it's very hard to say when, and people have been predicting it incorrectly for years—from chess to open-ended conversation to complex images, people keep expecting AI progress to reach a limit, and they keep being wrong. The way we train AI draws on fundamental principles of computation that suggest any intellectual task humans can do, a sufficiently large AI model should also be able to do. And right now, several of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world are throwing tens of billions at making that happen.",

Because AI will become capable enough to help us make better AI. This is recursive self-improvement—every generation of AIs making the next generation more powerful. This will happen very easily once we have AGI. If an artificial general intelligence can do any computer-based task that a human can do, then it can work on making better AI. In fact, AI is already starting to contribute to its own development—for example, by generating better prompts, creating better training data, designing better GPUs, writing code for experiments, and even generating research ideas. Over time, we'll only see more of this: AI doing better and more independently, even developing new algorithms and discovering novel ways to interact with the world. As far as we can tell, it's not like there will be one specific day when AIs tell researchers to step away from the computer. If anything, it will probably look more like what we're currently seeing: humans deliberately putting AI systems in the driver's seat more and more, because they keep getting faster, cheaper, and smarter. Beyond a certain point, they'll be doing things humans can't do, far more capable, coming up with innovations we wouldn't be able to think of and perhaps wouldn't even understand.

        "script": "Self-improvement leads to artificial superintelligence. So what comes next? What happens if AI starts making better AIs? The next step after artificial general intelligence is artificial superintelligence (ASI). An ASI isn't just more capable than any human, it's more capable than every human combined, and after AGI, this might not take long. After all, once you have one AGI, it's very easy to make more—you just copy the code and run it on a different server. This is already what happens now. Once OpenAI finished training ChatGPT, it was able to put out millions of copies running in parallel shortly after. And there are other advantages AIs have. For one, they're much faster. An AI like ChatGPT can produce a page of dense technical writing in under a minute and read thousands of words in seconds. The best chess AIs can beat the best human players even if they're only given a second to pick each move. On top of that, it's much easier for AI to share improvements. If one AI figures out a way to make itself smarter, it can copy that across to the other millions of AIs that are busy doing something else. What's more, there's no reason to think individual AIs will stall at whatever level humans can reach. Historically, that's not how this works. If we look at the tasks where AI reached human level more than five years ago—board games, facial recognition, certain types of medical diagnostics—they're still continuing to get better. If you imagine an average human who miraculously had the ability to memorize the entire internet, read and write ten times faster, and clone themselves at will, it's obvious how that could get out of hand. Now imagine those clones could edit their own brains to make each one more capable. It's easy to see how they might quickly become more powerful than all of humanity combined.",

At this point, we've somewhat fancifully labeled it incomprehensible machine gods. Let's be clear: AI isn't going to start doing magic. We can be confident they won't invent perpetual motion machines or faster-than-light travel, because there are physical limits to what's possible. But we are nowhere near those limits. Modern smartphones have a million times more memory than the computer used on the Apollo Moon mission, yet they're still a million times less dense than DNA, which still isn't at the physical limit. Think about how our current technology would look to even the best scientists from a hundred years ago. They would understand it's hypothetically possible to create billions of devices that can instantly transmit gigabytes of information across the world using powerful radios in space, but they'd still be surprised to hear that everyone carries a phone to watch videos of cartoon dogs. We don't know what artificial superintelligence would be able to do, but it would probably sound even crazier to us than the modern world would to someone from 1920. Think about it this way: progress happens faster and faster as AI improves itself. Where does this end? The self-improvement process wouldn't stop until there were no more improvements to be made. So try to imagine an AI system so powerful that there's no way to make it any smarter. Using the unimaginably advanced engineering skills of the most powerful possible AI, such a system would bump up against the only limits left—the laws of physics. At that point, AI abilities still wouldn't be literal magic, but they might seem like it to us. If that happens, we'll be completely powerless compared to them.",

Even a small change in inputs or conditions means the robot's software must be altered or even completely reprogrammed. This is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult.

However, AI methods allow humans to teach robots how to move, either directly with the robot or using suits and gloves equipped with motion sensors.

Half a century later, predictive models are embedded in many of the products we use every day, performing two fundamental jobs: one is to classify data, like whether there's another car on the road or if a patient has cancer; the other is to predict future outcomes, like whether a stock will rise or which YouTube video you might want to watch next. The first step in the process is acquiring and cleaning data—lots of it. The better the data represents the problem, the better the results. Garbage in, garbage out. The data needs to contain some kind of signal to be valuable for making predictions, and data scientists perform a task called feature engineering to transform raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem. The next step is to separate the data into a training set and a testing set. The training data is fed into an algorithm to build a model, and the testing data is used to validate the model's accuracy or error.",

Every one of these algorithms improves by comparing its predictions to an error function.

Hey guys, and welcome to Vlad's Insights, where each day I share one valuable insight from my collection of 400+ videos. The old way of keyword research is dead. While everyone's still chasing 'best CRM software' with 10,000 monthly searches, Google's AI is ignoring that outdated approach. Here are the three new keyword research techniques dominating in 2025. Number one: prompt research, not keyword research. People aren't typing 'dog training' anymore, they're asking ChatGPT, 'What's the best way to stop my seven-month-old Golden Retriever from chewing my furniture?' Here's the hack: go to ChatGPT, type 'How do I' and let it autocomplete. Those suggestions are what people are really searching for now. Do this on Perplexity, Google, AI, and Bing Chat. Each platform shows conversation patterns. Number two: answer engine hijacking. Forget ranking number one on Google. Now you need to be the answer AI gives people. The secret: 70% of AI queries are 'how' and 'what' questions. Find these and create content that answers them directly in the first two sentences. Tools like Otterly.ai show which brands AI is mentioning. If you're not there, you're invisible. Number three: clustering. It sounds fancy, but it's simple. Instead of targeting 'iPhone 15,' you target everything connected to it: Apple, smartphones, iOS, camera quality, battery life. Google's brain now connects 800 billion facts. It doesn't see isolated keywords, it sees relationships. Your move: build content around topic clusters, not single keywords. Here's your action plan. Stop using traditional keyword tools—they measure yesterday's behavior. Start conversations with AI tools and see what questions they suggest. Create answer-first content with the direct answer in your first paragraph. Think in topics, not keywords. Cover everything related to your subject. The brands winning in 2025 aren't optimizing for search engines anymore, they're optimizing for AI engines. Ready to dominate AI search before your competitors catch on?

In today's digital world, user experience design is evolving rapidly, and artificial intelligence plays a big role in that change. Let's break down how this technology is reshaping user experience design in the context of digital transformation and global tech trends.\n First off, personalization is a game changer. Artificial intelligence analyzes user behavior, preferences and context to create experiences that feel Taylor made. Imagine a website that knows what you like and suggests content just for you. This predictive approach shifts the focus from simply reacting to user actions to anticipating their needs. Users now expect seamless and personalized interactions. Next, let's talk about.\n design processes. Designers can now use AI tools to generate wirefames and layouts from simple text prompts. This capability allows for rapid prototyping and iteration, giving designers the freedom to experiment with different ideas quickly. Plus, AI helps maintain consistency across various screens and devices, which saves time and effort. Accessibility is also getting a boost from artificial intelligence. AI can automatically check.\n designs for compliance with accessibility standards, ensuring that digital products are usable by everyone. It identifies potential issues and suggests improvements, making it easier for designers to create inclusive experiences. This means more people can enjoy the benefits of digital technology. When it comes to user research and testing, artificial intelligence enhances the process significantly. It can analyze large data sets to reveal patterns.\n user behavior. this makes AB testing more efficient as AI can quickly evaluate multiple design variations and user responses. the result: more accurate data driven decisions that align with what users truly want. lastly, the role of designers is shifting, but not disappearing. while artificial intelligence automates many routine tasks, it serves as a supportive tool for designers. they still guide the...\n and interpret the outputs, ensuring that creativity and human centered design remaines at the forefront. In the context of digital transformation strategies, integrating artificial intelligence into user experience design helps organizations create more engaging and user centered digital products. It leads to faster development cycles and improved user satisfaction. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, we can expect user experience design.\n to incorporate even more intelligent systems that not only respond to users, but also shape their digital journeys.",

        "script": "What exactly is artificial intelligence? We speak of AI when computer systems perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. This includes, for example, recognizing images, making decisions, or engaging in dialogue. To do this, AI systems must be equipped with knowledge and experience. This can be achieved in two ways. You can program each individual instruction so that the machine solves the task step by step. This is comparable to a cooking recipe or assembly instructions. Alternatively, you can use programs that learn from data themselves. This enables them to detect relevant information, draw conclusions, or make predictions. This is known as machine learning. We have all probably dealt with AI at some point in our lives when we watch films, listen to music, or shop online. AI gives us recommendations about what we might like. AI is capable of converting spoken language into text and translating it into other languages. AI is a central component of robotics. Robots make our everyday lives easier or take on strenuous activities. Self-driving vehicles recognize their environment through AI and can react to it. AI is becoming increasingly important in medicine. It supports doctors when diagnosing diseases. Also, more and more patients use AI-based apps for initial diagnosis. In the educational sector, AI helps to individualize learning activities, for example, on digital learning platforms. AI is becoming increasingly important. Once we understand how AI works, we can better gauge where it can support everyday activities at home and at work, and where we would rather make our own decisions. AI will not replace humans, but it is getting better and better at supporting us. For this, we need an AI-competent society.",

        "script": "First up, unsupervised learning. This approach is ideal for analyzing all the profiles to find general similarities and useful patterns. Maybe certain patients have similar disease presentations, or perhaps a treatment produces specific sets of side effects. This broad pattern-seeking approach can be used to identify similarities between patient profiles and find emerging patterns, all without human guidance. But let's imagine doctors are looking for something more specific. These physicians want to create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data: medical images and test results from both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then they input this data into a program designed to identify features shared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently it sees certain features, the program will assign values to those features' diagnostic significance, generating an algorithm for diagnosing future patients. However, unlike unsupervised learning, doctors and computer scientists have an active role in what happens next. Doctors make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy of the algorithm's predictions. Then computer scientists can use the updated data sets to adjust the program's parameters and improve its accuracy. This hands-on approach is called supervised learning. Now let's say these doctors want to design another algorithm.\n to recommend treatment plans, since these plans will be implemented in stages and they may change depending on each individual's response to treatment.",

        "script": "The doctors decide to use reinforcement learning. This program uses an iterative approach to gather feedback about which medications, dosages, and treatments are most effective. Then it compares that data against each patient's profile to create their unique, optimal treatment plan. As the treatments progress and the program receives more feedback, it can constantly update the plan for each patient. None of these three techniques are inherently smarter than any other, while some require more or less human intervention. They all have their own strengths and weaknesses, which make them best suited for certain tasks. However, by using them together, researchers can build complex AI systems where individual programs can supervise and teach each other. For example, when our unsupervised learning program finds groups of patients that are similar, it could send that data to a connected supervised learning program. That program could then incorporate this information into its predictions, or perhaps dozens of reinforcement learning programs might simulate potential patient outcomes to collect feedback about different treatment plans. There are numerous ways to create these machine learning systems, and perhaps the most promising models are those that mimic the relationship between neurons in the brain. These artificial neural networks can use millions of connections to tackle difficult tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and even language translation. However, the more self-directed these models become, the harder it is for computer scientists to determine how these self-trained algorithms arrive at their solutions. Researchers are already looking at ways to make machine learning more transparent, but as AI becomes more involved in our everyday lives, these enigmatic decisions have an increasingly large impact on our work, health, and safety. As machines continue learning to investigate, negotiate, and communicate, we must also consider how to teach them to operate ethically. Today's computers can pilot spacecraft and perform surgery, but according to computer scientist Alan Turing, the real test of a computer's intelligence is basic small talk.

        "script": "So my name is Mike Waldridge. I'm a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Oxford and Director of AI at the Alan Turing Institute in London. I've been an AI researcher for more than 30 years, and the reason I'm here today is that I'm this year's Royal Institution Christmas Lecturer, which will focus on artificial intelligence. The question, 'What is artificial intelligence?' is phenomenally difficult. Nobody owns artificial intelligence; it's a very broad field, and people have very different ideas about what it is and what it should be. For some, AI is the Hollywood dream: building machines as capable, or even more capable, than human beings—machines that could do everything a human can. This is sometimes called general artificial intelligence. For others, and I am in this camp, AI is about building tools: computers that can perform very specific tasks better than humans, such as diagnosing abnormalities on a heart scan or spotting tumors on an X-ray. Most AI work focuses on these kinds of problems. I say it's a broad field—nobody owns it, and everyone has their own views. The center of gravity in AI is extending the capability of machines to do things that currently only humans can do. I dislike the word 'revolution,' but what we've seen are genuine breakthroughs: a step change in AI capability around 2020. Prior to ChatGPT, AI systems were released that were markedly better than previous ones, which captured researchers' attention. We realized we were in a new era. Things have definitely changed, and everyone in my community is exploring what these new technologies can do. Understanding them is no trivial task—they are phenomenally complicated. This moment is akin to the emergence of the World Wide Web; general-purpose AI technologies are reaching a mass market very quickly. When the web appeared, it took five or six years to reach a mass audience, but general-purpose AI tools have been adopted much faster. Over the last few decades, technological changes like smartphones or the web took years to unfold. AI adoption is happening in months, even weeks. It will be embedded in everything, and to some extent, it already is. Within a year, you'll be able to select a paragraph in your document and have options to summarize it, convert it into clear English for a 10-year-old, or tailor it for a professional audience. People won't even realize it's AI, but it is. This generation will find ways to use AI we can't imagine, creating new businesses and services, enhancing productivity, and freeing people from drudgery to focus on tasks requiring human intelligence, insight, and emotional understanding. It will also enrich leisure activities, gaming, and countless other applications. Yet, for every beneficial use, there are risks of misuse, so it's vital to understand the implications and use the technology responsibly. Data privacy is a key concern, as people unknowingly provide information about themselves. Jobs that involve processing content, summarizing documents, creating routine text or artwork, will be affected. Jobs that largely follow a script and require only understanding human input are vulnerable. In the UK, call centers employing hundreds of thousands of people are at potential risk of automation. AI is transforming science. Experimental sciences, which produce vast quantities of data, can now use AI to analyze patterns and form hypotheses. Some scientists fear this represents the end of civilization, as machines may form hypotheses. For example, an astronomer classifying spiral versus barred galaxies can train an AI to identify them automatically, rather than counting manually. Neural networks excel at this, and similar applications exist across biology, chemistry, and other sciences. I am excited by this field because tools that were unimaginable at the start of my career now exist. Large language models allow direct interaction in ordinary language, transforming AI into a new kind of science. Philosophical questions about AI's understanding of people have become practical ones we can explore hands-on, which is enormously exciting.",

For example, a thermostat turns on the heater when it senses the temperature is too low, and an alarm clock rings at a set time. These devices don't change or learn; they just respond to specific triggers. Other examples include automatic doors that open when someone approaches or a calculator that performs math for you.",

So, if you ask Siri for a restaurant, it might consider the time, your location, and places you've liked before. One major advantage of context-based AI is that it can make predictions by learning from your data over time. It can anticipate what you might need or want in the future. For example, YouTube and TikTok use your viewing history to suggest videos you might enjoy, and we all know how effective they are.",

In healthcare, some AI systems analyze medical images, such as MRIs or X-rays, to spot early signs of diseases like cancer, often with greater accuracy than human doctors. Narrow AI can even surpass world champions, as seen with AlphaGo, which defeated the top player in the ancient board game Go.

For example, ChatGPT can answer complex questions and hold conversations that seem like reasoning, but it is following patterns and data rather than genuinely understanding or being aware. Reasoning AI relies on vast amounts of data and complex algorithms to handle tasks requiring extensive decision-making. A good example is self-driving cars.

It could plan your schedule, solve tough problems, or even give life advice, acting as a personal assistant that knows you and your preferences.

Similarly, we cannot fully predict the breakthroughs super intelligent AI might achieve. It could solve today's toughest problems, such as curing all diseases, ending global hunger, or even extending human life. The intelligence gap between humans and super intelligent AI would be enormous, making its actions and decisions difficult for us to comprehend.

Such an AI could potentially feel its own emotions and thoughts, perhaps even experience things beyond our comprehension. It would no longer be just a machine and would raise significant ethical and philosophical questions. If an AI became truly self-aware, should it have rights like humans? Should we treat it as a conscious being? This also raises serious concerns: a self-aware AI would have its own needs and interests, which might not always align with humans.

          "script": "I want to start by talking about three things that keep me up at night. The first, which may also be common for you, is climate change. Climate change absolutely keeps me awake. The second thing is that people may not realize when artificial intelligence is making decisions that directly impact their lives—like the interest rate on your loan, whether you get a job you applied for, or whether your child gets into the college they want. Today, AI is making decisions that directly affect you. The third concern is that even when people know an AI is making a decision about them, they may assume that, because it's not a fallible human with biases, the AI will make morally or ethically flawless decisions. That could not be farther from the truth. Over 80% of proof-of-concept AI projects stall during testing, often because people do not trust the results from the AI model. So we're going to talk a lot about trust. When thinking about trust, there are five pillars. First, fairness: how can you ensure the model is fair to everyone, especially historically underrepresented groups? Second, explainability: is your AI model explainable so you can tell end users what data sets were used, what methods and expertise were applied, and the data lineage involved in training the model? Third, robustness: can you ensure the AI model cannot be hacked to disadvantage some people or unfairly benefit others? Fourth, transparency: are you informing people that an AI model is being used and providing access to a fact sheet or metadata to learn more about it? Fifth, data privacy: are you protecting people's data? IBM has also proposed three principles for AI in organizations. First, remember that earning trust in AI is not just a technological challenge; it is a socio-technical challenge, meaning it involves people and must be addressed holistically. This involves three major areas: people and culture, process or governance, and tooling. For people and culture, consider the diversity of your teams, especially your data science team curating data to train models. Diversity reduces the chance of error, as shown by the proven mathematical theory known as the wisdom of crowds. Second, process or governance: what standards will your organization uphold for AI fairness, explainability, and accountability for both employees and the market? Third, tooling: what AI engineering methods and frameworks can you use to ensure the five pillars are met? In the next session, we will focus specifically on people and culture.",

But as AI moves from research labs into the real world, more people are becoming aware of ethical concerns associated with these applications. There are three major ethical concerns with AI. The first involves how we use AI. Normally, when we develop AI in the lab, it is for good reasons, such as using video tracking in healthcare to monitor patient recovery. However, the same technology can be misused, for example, in smart bombs or by governments to track citizens, creating an Orwellian scenario. We need to consider potential unintended outcomes when developing AI algorithms. The second ethical concern is access to AI. AI increasingly requires bigger, faster, and more expensive machines, which only large international companies can afford. This concentration of control limits the number of people influencing AI's future use. Ideally, society should have a voice in how AI benefits everyone. The third concern is that AI does not think like humans or share our values. The risk is not malice, but that AI will follow instructions in ways we do not anticipate. Vague instructions can lead AI to act in unexpected, potentially harmful ways. This can result in issues like bias. If AI is not guided to avoid bias against certain ethnic groups or genders, it may inherit biases from the data it uses. We must limit such effects, provide unbiased data, and monitor AI behavior to mitigate risks from this 'alien mind.' We need open discussions about AI's capabilities, limitations, and how to ensure it benefits as many people as possible.",

The first step is to establish a set of guidelines to follow when creating or interacting with AI systems. For example, IBM's three core principles are: First, artificial intelligence is meant to augment human intelligence, not replace it. Second, data and insights belong to their creator. If we use customer data, it remains their property. Third, solutions must be transparent and explainable, meaning we need visibility into who is training the system, the data used, and how decisions are made. For instance, a hotel recommendation system might determine room assignments or special perks for guests. While these features enhance customer experience, we must assess potential harm. Questions include: Is the data sold to advertisers? Is it secure? Are differently-abled users included in the algorithm? Once rules and potential issues are identified, the next step is to implement guardrails—rules the AI must follow, such as not selling data to advertisers. Data diversity is crucial; without it, the AI cannot serve all users effectively. Tools like IBM's AI Fairness 360 help detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models. Other tools assist with privacy compliance and uncertainty detection. With clear rules, problem identification, and corrective actions, AI becomes a shared responsibility.

Ensuring that AI is developed, designed, and deployed ethically is critical given its societal impact. AI ethics, also called ethical AI or responsible AI, refers both to the process of developing AI and to the AI products themselves. Companies, governments, associations, and communities have drafted codes of ethics addressing accountability, trust, transparency, fairness, and agency. Philosopher Luciano Floridi analyzed many of these codes and developed an overarching framework of five key principles: Principle one: Beneficence - AI should improve the well-being of people and the planet. Principle two: Non-maleficence - AI should do no harm, protecting privacy, autonomy, employability, and other interests. Principle three: Autonomy - human freedom and independence must be preserved, while machine autonomy should be limited. Principle four: Justice - AI must be developed and deployed to promote fairness, equity, and related values. Principle five: Explicability - understanding how and why AI systems work is essential to ensure accountability and proper responsibility for their impacts. Ethical AI goes beyond preventing harm; AI for social good emphasizes the moral responsibility of developers to advance social welfare.

A random stranger wrote that my work in AI is going to end humanity. I get it—AI is hot right now. It's in the headlines almost every day, sometimes for exciting things like discovering new molecules for medicine or that Pope in a white puffer coat, but other times the headlines are dark, like a chatbot telling someone to divorce their spouse, or an AI meal planner suggesting a recipe with chlorine gas. We've also heard a lot about doomsday scenarios, existential risk, and the singularity, with letters and events organized to prevent it. I study AI's societal impacts, and while we can't predict the future, we know AI is already causing problems. It contributes to climate change, uses artists' and authors' work without consent, and can discriminate against entire communities. We need to track AI's impacts, be transparent, and create tools for better understanding, so future AI models are more trustworthy and sustainable. Sustainability matters because the cloud that AI runs on is made of metal and plastic and consumes vast amounts of energy. Each query to an AI model has an environmental cost. Last year, I helped lead the BigScience initiative, creating Bloom, the first open large language model with a focus on ethics, transparency, and consent. Our study found that training Bloom consumed as much energy as 30 homes in a year and emitted 25 tons of CO2—equivalent to driving around the planet five times—just to tell a knock-knock joke. Similar models like GPT-3 emit 20 times more. Tech companies often don't measure these costs, and AI models are growing rapidly. Large language models have grown 20 times in size over five years, increasing environmental costs. Our work shows that larger models emit 14 times more carbon for the same task as smaller, efficient ones. Deploying AI in phones, search engines, smart fridges, and speakers adds up quickly. Instead of focusing only on future existential risks, we should address current impacts. I helped create CodeCarbon, a tool estimating energy use and emissions during AI training, allowing informed choices for sustainability or renewable energy deployment. Artists and authors struggle to prove their work was used without consent. Spawning AI, founded by artists, created Have I Been Trained, a tool to check massive datasets. Searching Lyon 5B, I found some images of me, but most were other people. For artists like Carla Ortiz, this tool provides crucial evidence for copyright lawsuits against AI companies. Spawning AI partnered with Hugging Face to create opt-in and opt-out mechanisms for datasets, ensuring human-created art isn't treated as an all-you-can-eat training resource. Bias is another major concern. AI models can encode stereotypes, racism, and sexism. Dr. Joy Buolamwini found that facial recognition systems often failed to detect her face unless she wore a white mask, with worse performance for women of color. Biased models in law enforcement have led to false accusations and wrongful imprisonment, as in the case of Porsche Woodruff, wrongfully accused of carjacking while eight months pregnant. These systems are black boxes, and even creators can't fully explain their behavior. In image generation, biases are reproduced, affecting terms like \"dangerous criminal,\" which is dangerous when deployed in society. I created the Stable Bias Explorer, letting users explore image generation bias through professions. For example, envisioning a scientist often results in white men in lab coats, reflecting systemic bias across 150 professions, unlike real-world statistics. Tools like this empower people to understand AI, even without coding knowledge. AI permeates our phones, social media, justice systems, and economies. It's crucial that AI remains accessible, understandable, and accountable. There's no single solution for bias, copyright, or climate change, but measuring AI's impact helps us address these issues. We can create guardrails to protect society and the planet. Companies can choose sustainable or copyright-respecting models, legislators can develop informed regulations, and users can select trustworthy AI models. Together, we can guide AI in a responsible direction. Thank you.",

Despite variations in lighting, landscape, and dimensions of the field, the AI robot must perform as expected. This ability to react appropriately to a new situation is called generalized learning. The robot is now at a crossroad, one paved and the other rocky. The robot must determine which path to take based on the circumstances. This demonstrates the robot's reasoning ability.

By the end of the day, we know that AI is there. But do we really understand what is happening, and can we trust the output of these applications? Today, the approach we take toward these technologies is to say that consumers can figure it out on their own—they can read terms and conditions on websites and choose not to participate in certain digital environments. But increasingly, these products and platforms are part of our lives. They shape how we provide education, how we look for jobs, and that power imbalance cannot be addressed by simply giving consumers more information or individual rights of complaint. To change the structural ways in which these technologies are designed, we must push responsibilities back onto designers and organizations relying on these technologies to change their practices. Technologies like artificial intelligence have the potential to empower people and broaden perspectives, or they can widen inequalities and fail to address societal challenges. But we cannot blame the technology itself. It's not about the technologies; it's about developing frameworks and shaping rules that allow these technologies to achieve our goals. We must embed ethical principles, protecting and promoting human rights and human dignity, which ultimately determine the outcomes. Responsible governance of AI technologies without the buy-in of Big Tech and other companies is impossible. We need to explain to them that ethics is not abstract; ethics should be bottom-up, a dynamic system that enables innovation and builds trust in their products, which leads to business success. Ethical debate has played an important role in shaping AI regulation. Over the last five years, we have seen numerous charters, declarations, and ethical principles, and now these principles are being applied practically. Many countries in Latin America have national AI strategies, and some are going further, regulating AI principles through hard law. In the European Union, draft AI Acts are under discussion. In the U.S., Congress is examining the monopoly power of tech companies. Globally, countries are moving from awareness to strategy to implementation and regulation. Lack of access to these technologies excludes people from responsible governance debates. Decisions generated without their inclusion do not apply to them—they are effectively erased. Previously colonized countries are often excluded from these conversations, worsening the problem. The first step is identifying which groups are excluded. When regulating AI, we discuss privacy, data protection, freedom of expression, and basic human rights. Sound regulatory frameworks must protect privacy, enhance transparency, and ensure accountability. This requires listening to everyone to build strong foundations for AI to serve human goals. The great risk now is that AI becomes an arms race, with countries focusing only on their own context and viewing others as competitors. AI could build bridges and connect people and nations, but it could also do the opposite. This is the debate you should care about—it is shaping our future with technology.",

I recently had a chance to sit down with Bill Gates to discuss how he sees the present and future of AI. Bill Gates, pleasure to have you on. We've been tracking AI progress on the show. People now talk about AGI, artificial general intelligence. What's the difference between AI and what people predict as AGI? Definitions vary, and one way to measure AI is when it can perform tasks like telesales or support more cheaply and accurately than humans. That's looking at labor substitution. Or you can look at the most creative tasks, like developing a new drug to treat tuberculosis. Is AI just assisting humans, or will it eventually replace them? For coding, AI can handle simple tasks, but the most complex coding is still beyond its reach. Experts disagree whether this will happen in one to two years or closer to ten. Yet AI is improving at a surprising rate, with capabilities like deep research. I take complex questions a few times a day and find AI does an excellent job gathering and summarizing information. Satya Nadella says 30% of Microsoft's code is now AI-generated. This implies fewer coders will be needed. Paralegals in law firms perform discovery, essentially pattern recognition, which AI can do easily. Similarly, entry-level accounting tasks can be automated. White-collar, college-educated jobs will face a more challenging environment. Productivity gains can free people to have smaller class sizes, longer vacations, or accomplish more—not necessarily a bad thing. The concern is whether AI progresses so quickly that society can't adjust. Meanwhile, as robotic arms improve, even more labor sectors may be affected. These are profound changes. I'm working with Microsoft and OpenAI to ensure these tools benefit low-income countries in health, education, and agriculture. Finally, what advice would you give young people entering AI? At profound levels, questions become almost philosophical. In this transition, learning to use these tools is both fun and empowering. Previously, I relied on smart people to clarify physics concepts, but now I use AI for deep research and share answers with friends, often learning more myself. Tools and platforms like Khan Academy are spreading knowledge worldwide, and tracking these developments is crucial. This doesn't prevent dislocation, but my advice remains: be curious, read, and use the latest tools. Recommendations for young people: be curious, read, and use AI. Absolutely.

        "script": "Hey little kitty, how is the new AI system working? Oh, great, but what is it? Well, that's a question we all need to understand to keep up with changing times. In today's episode, let's answer this revolutionary technological question: What is artificial intelligence? Zoom in. Have you ever heard of Alexa or Siri, seen a self-driving car, or wondered how your phone's face recognition works? Believe it or not, all these technologies have something in common: they use artificial intelligence, or AI, to perform tasks. What is that exactly? Before answering, let's see what the word 'intelligence' means. Intelligence is the ability to gain and apply knowledge and skills. For example, when we learn the alphabet from A to Z in kindergarten, we acquire this information and can use it to create words, sentences, or solve problems. Similarly, when a robot or computer uses programmed information to solve problems, it is also using a form of intelligence. However, this type of intelligence differs from human intelligence. It is called artificial intelligence, or AI. AI systems are designed to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and make decisions based on available information. But the crucial question is: is it really helpful to us? AI can help humans perform tasks more efficiently and enable machines to do tasks difficult or impossible for humans. For example, AI can help robots perform tasks in factories or hospitals and help self-driving cars navigate roads and avoid accidents. One of AI's best features is its ability to process and analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately. This makes it useful in industries like healthcare, finance, and retail, where fast and accurate decisions are essential. In this way, AI is a powerful tool transforming our lives. But as they say, with great power comes great responsibility. It's vital to use AI responsibly and not become overly dependent, as this could reduce self-sufficiency, motivation, and physical and mental activity, directly affecting our health. Another concern is that AI could disrupt industries and potentially replace human workers, leading to unemployment. Therefore, it is vital to ensure AI development and use follow ethical principles to maximize benefits and minimize negative impacts. Trivia time: one of the earliest milestones in AI was the creation of the first computer program designed to play chess in the 1950s. In 1997, a program called Deep Blue made headlines by defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. Hope you learned something new today. Until next time, it's me, Dr. Binox, zooming in. Mr. Ye, please exercise on my behalf. Never mind.",

        "script": "Can AI read my mind? I'd be more concerned if another person could read my mind using AI. Jokes aside, when it comes to AI, nothing seems too far-fetched these days. But this story is less about AI and more about humanity. Here's a story that sounds like science fiction, but isn't. It's about AI, but not dystopian. Researchers in Sydney have built an AI-powered decoder that translates brain signals into words using sensors embedded in a wearable electroencephalogram (EEG) cap. This experimental device detects the brain's electrical activity. The information is sent to a monitoring unit where a deep learning AI decoder interprets and translates the signals into words. A large language model refines the decoded text and corrects possible errors. The final selection of words is displayed on a monitor. The model is in early stages, trained on a small set of words and sentences to simplify word recognition. The concept of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) isn't new. Several systems connect the human brain directly to machines. In simple terms, a BCI is a device that senses brain activity, such as attention to move your hand, and translates it to drive a computer. The most famous example is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which uses a tiny chip implanted directly into the brain through surgery. The Neuralink chip has been successfully implanted in three individuals who can control devices like cursors or video games with their thoughts. We currently have clinical trials in the U.S. for a product called Telepathy, allowing users to control phones or computers purely with their thoughts. Trials are also approved in Canada, the UK, and the UAE. Simply put, the Neuralink device allows device control by thinking. To illustrate, the first user, Nolan from the DJ Section, uses a Neuralink device to control a MacBook Pro cursor with his mind—no eye tracking or other sensors. This is the first time someone has fully controlled a cursor with a Neuralink device. It's very exciting, and I'm happy to be part of it. Similarly, U.S.-based Paradromics is developing a BCI system called Connexis, which uses a microelectrode array implanted beneath the skull to read neural activity with high precision, aiming to restore speech and movement in patients with severe neurological disorders. In comparison, the system developed in Sydney is entirely non-invasive: a wearable EEG cap detects brain waves and an external AI unit translates them into text without surgery or implants. Results are not perfect but promising. The AI correctly identifies target words about 75% of the time, with researchers aiming for 90% accuracy—a major leap for a device relying solely on brain waves. Scientists analyze medical conditions to identify affected functions and address unmet patient needs through technology, restoring function as much as possible. The sky is the limit after that. While all three BCIs share a common goal, the non-invasiveness and simplicity of the University of NSW system make it the most compelling prospect. Implications could be transformative for stroke survivors and those with speech difficulties or paralysis. It's easy to imagine wearable devices translating thoughts into silent commands for augmented reality or enabling thought-based communication.",

        "script": "Today on Forbes, you're not imagining it: AI is already taking tech jobs. Between meetings in April, Misha Koffman, CEO of the freelance marketplace Fiverr, sent a memo to his 1,200 employees that didn't mince words: \"AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it's coming for my job too. This is a wake-up call.\" The memo detailed Koffman's thesis that AI would elevate everyone's abilities: easy tasks would become no-brainers, hard tasks would become easy, and impossible tasks would become merely hard. He noted that because AI tools are free to use, no one has an advantage. People who didn't adapt would be \"doomed,\" he warned. Koffman tells Forbes, \"I hear the conversation around the office. I hear developers ask each other, 'Guys, are we going to have a job in two years?' I felt this needed validation from me, so they knew they weren't imagining things.\" Already, younger and less experienced programmers are seeing a drop in employment. Ruuchen, a post-doctoral fellow at the Digital Economy Lab of Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI, said the total number of employed entry-level developers aged 18 to 25 has dropped \"slightly\" since 2022, after the launch of ChatGPT. It's not just lack of experience that makes jobs harder to get; the market may also be tougher for those who are just average at their work. In the age of AI, only exceptional employees have an edge. Chen and her colleagues studied large-scale payroll data in the U.S. shared by HR company ADP to examine generative AI's impact on the workforce. The decline in employment for entry-level developers is small but significant for engineering in the tech industry, an occupation long associated with wealth and high salaries. Employees at Resources were replaced by AI in May, part of broader cuts that terminated 8,000 employees. Also in May, Luis von Ahn, CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, said the company would stop using contractors for work AI could perform. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of the buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, said in May that the company had cut its workforce by 40%, partly due to AI investments. Microsoft made waves earlier this month when it laid off 9,000 employees, about 4% of its workforce. The company did not explicitly cite AI as a reason but has increased AI spending and highlighted savings from using the technology. CEO Satya Nadella said in April that as much as 30% of the company's code is now written by AI. A laid-off Microsoft employee told Forbes, \"This is what happens when a company is rearranging priorities.\" It's difficult to pinpoint the exact motivation behind job cuts. The overall economic environment, marked by uncertainties such as President Donald Trump's erratic tariff plans, may also be a factor. Many companies became bloated during the pandemic, and recent layoffs could be correcting overhiring. For full coverage, check out Richard Neva's piece on Forbes.com.

        "script": "What exactly is generative AI? When new content is created by artificial intelligence, it is called generative AI. This can include generating text, images, videos, music, or voices. To do this, you describe in a chat dialogue box what you want the AI to create. This description is called a prompt. Generative AI tools can answer all sorts of questions, summarize complex information, and generate diverse ideas quickly. Depending on their use, they can create short stories, paintings, code, or musical compositions. The foundation for this creation lies in large amounts of data that the AI system accesses to identify patterns and similarities. The content produced by AI is new, often impressive, and sometimes difficult to distinguish from human-created content. Generative AI can also be misused in so-called deepfakes, producing images or videos that seem real. AI-generated texts are also difficult to recognize as machine-made. Moreover, AI can provide answers that sound correct but are actually incorrect; this is called hallucination. The quality of AI-generated content depends on both the quality of the data used and the quality of the prompt given. To use generative AI effectively, we need to guide the tools with meaningful prompts and use them thoughtfully. Generative AI holds immense potential and can help us in many ways, such as serving as a writing or learning partner.

We are definitely in an AI hype cycle, but we're not focused on the 2024 or 2025 hype cycle; we're focused on the very long term. Artificial intelligence is a very big and important macro trend, akin to the industrial revolution. This is a trend we've been investing in for decades and will continue to invest in for decades to come. Constantine, you wrote a piece a year or so ago identifying how Gartner sees hype cycles: wild enthusiasm followed by a trough of disillusionment. Where are we in terms of consumer adoption and actual AI ROI? You're exactly right. Let me give a few examples: AI changes over time. When I was an AI researcher long ago, we were barely scratching the surface of natural language processing, understanding, and computer vision. 2022 and 2023 were about large language models and answering questions—the advent of modern AI. 2024 was the year of agents: an AI that completes tasks, not just tells you how to do them. An example is our portfolio company Expo, founded by the creator of GitHub Copilot, creating an agent for cybersecurity. Within months, they developed an AI that can outperform some of the best penetration testers. This AI attacks websites—with permission—finds vulnerabilities, and reports back. 2024 was all about agents; 2025 and beyond will likely be about swarms of AI agents, networks working together and possibly against each other to achieve results. Constantine, there's a swarm of companies talking about AI agents. Salesforce is launching \"Agent Force\"; your portfolio company Rox is also focused on agents. How will they interact? Some will complement, some may compete. The excitement about agents is because AI can complete many impactful tasks. Rox is a great example of an AI agent that keeps humans in the loop. Instead of replacing the human seller, Rox empowers them with an agent that does research and preparation for meetings. Initially, Rox developed technology to auto-draft and auto-send emails, but keeping the human in the loop tripled performance. In cybersecurity, agents like Expo may complete entire tasks; in sales, agents like Rox augment human effort. Constantine, you're a big thinker. How many agent offerings do we really need, and how many companies like Rox can you back? It's just the beginning; the constraint is our creativity. AI has huge potential. For example, in healthcare and education, costs have risen for decades due to service expenses. AI can complete some tasks, driving down costs and improving outcomes. The sky is the limit for artificial intelligence, AI agents, and networks of AI.",

This embodies China's DeepSeek moment, shaping corporate culture and research initiatives. When will this impact the bottom line? The central government has launched a venture fund of about $138 billion for humanoid robots for industry and personal use, likely just the beginning. In China's challenging job market, online recruitment firm Chalpin reports that openings in the humanoid robotics sector have quadrupled this year, with salaries for algorithm engineers rising well above the average urban pay. Hong Kong-based Unitree is a pioneer in consumer robotics, offering its latest humanoid AI avatar, a four-foot-two, 77-pound D1, available online for $16. It can run, jump, and even fetch coffee.

Rapid automation in China's industrial sector also includes inspection and diagnostic bots with embodied AI, such as Lenovo's six-legged Daystar, deployed in places unsafe for humans. Chinese robots will likely enter the world offering unmatched value. Backed by state policy and funding, expect a myriad of new embodied AI products aiming to capture attention.

        "script": "On the internet, algorithms are all around you. You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you. You clicked, and the algorithm took note. When you open TikTok, the algorithm decides what you see. When you search through your photos, the algorithm finds them and may even create a short movie for you. When you buy something, the algorithm sets the price. The algorithm is also at your bank watching transactions for fraud. The stock market is full of algorithms trading with algorithms. \n\nYou might want to know how these algorithmic bots shape your world, especially when they don’t. In the past, humans built algorithmic bots by giving them clear instructions—if this, then that. But many problems are too complex for simple instructions. There are billions of financial transactions per second—how do you detect fraud? There are octillions of videos on NetTube—what should users see and what shouldn’t be allowed? For airline seats, what is the maximum price a user will pay? Algorithmic bots answer these questions—not perfectly, but better than humans could. How they work, however, is increasingly unknown, even to the humans who built them. Companies guard these methods closely. \n\nOne understandable way to build bots without fully knowing how they work is through a system of builder bots, teacher bots, and student bots. Say you want a bot to recognize letters and numbers in images. Humans know what a B and a 3 look like, but bots can’t understand instructions in words. Instead, a builder bot creates initial student bots randomly. Teacher bot tests them with labeled examples. Student bots that perform best are kept; the rest are recycled. Builder bot makes new copies with variations, teacher bot tests again, and the cycle repeats. \n\nAt first, surviving student bots are lucky. Over many iterations, combining what works and discarding failures, a student bot emerges that can reliably distinguish a B from a 3, even in unseen images. Neither teacher bot, builder bot, nor human overseers can fully understand how it works. Its internal wiring is highly complex, but it works. However, these bots are specialized—they excel at tasks they were trained for but fail at others, like recognizing upside-down images or unrelated objects. Humans can only expand their training by providing more diverse and longer tests, which is why companies collect massive amounts of data. \n\nFor example, a site like NetTube may want users to watch as long as possible. Teacher bot assigns student bots to monitor users’ behavior. Student bots learn which videos keep users engaged. Over repeated cycles, student bots become skilled at maximizing watch time. When asked how NetTube selects videos, the answer is essentially the student bot and the user data it accessed, guided by human-designed tests. The bot’s internal thought process remains unknowable; what matters is that it performs slightly better than previous bots. \n\nAcross the internet, similar tests optimize user interaction, pricing, content recommendations, or engagement. If it’s testable, it’s teachable. Student bots graduate from the warehouse to become the algorithm for their domain. Unlike traditional tools, these AI systems learn in ways no one fully understands. We can only guide them through the tests we design and must become comfortable with that. Our algorithmic bots are everywhere and here to stay. \n\nThe bots are watching. Like, comment, subscribe, hit the bell, and share—otherwise, the algorithm won’t show this video to others. Did you know I also have podcasts you can listen to, maybe while tidying up your room? Hours of content for you and watch time for the bots. Click, entertain yourself, help me, and help the bots.",
